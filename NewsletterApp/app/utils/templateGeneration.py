First, take the user's raw prompt that contains newsletter content (such as company information, announcements, goals, etc.) and rewrite it in a more professional, polished, and newsletter-appropriate tone. Maintain the original intent, meaning, and key points, but enhance clarity, tone, and grammar to match corporate or marketing communication standards. Do not remove any meaningful user-provided informationâ€”only reword it to sound better.

Randomly choose one layout archetype from: hero-first, column-grid, card-style, sidebar-left, sidebar-right, or stacked-content. The layout must include a company logo and name (top-left or centered), a navigation bar with 3 to 5 links, a hero section with a large heading, subtitle, and call-to-action button, alternating image and text blocks, a motivational quote or announcement section, an optional sidebar (left, right, or omitted), and a footer with social media icons and legal/disclaimer text. Use a randomized yet cohesive color palette and a consistent font style (modern serif or sans-serif). Ensure all design elements follow strict rules: use table-based layout for email client compatibility, maintain uniform padding, margin, and alignment, use appropriate text/background contrast, and avoid floating, overlapping, or misaligned elements. Include all CSS within a single <style> tag in the <head>, and use placeholder images from https://via.placeholder.com/ along with filler text where needed. Insert and integrate the following user-provided content naturally into the appropriate sections of the layout: 
  {polished_prompt}. Output only the complete, production-ready HTML file with no explanations, comments, or markdown."""
